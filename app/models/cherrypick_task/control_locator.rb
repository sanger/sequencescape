# A cherrypick {Batch} can source one or more controls from a {ControlPlate}
# For the initial destination plate in a batch these controls are distributed
# (pseudo)randomly across available wells. (Two controls can't occupy the same
# wells) Subsequent destination plates within the same batch will offset the
# controls by a fixed amount to ensure destination plates in a batch have
# different control locations.
# This is especially important for negative controls, as it allows plate swaps
# to be identified (the negative control location can be thought of as a
# fingerprint).
#
# Once all well locations have been used, an new set of random locations will
# be generated, and the cycle will begin again.
#
# We need to be particularly careful with the offset value, as otherwise we risk
# reusing wells before the full cycle has been completed. For this reason we
# select prime numbers that are NOT a factor of the number of available wells.
class CherrypickTask::ControlLocator
  # A cherrypick batch may contain multiple destination plates. In this case the control wells
  # should be located at different locations on each destination. The positions on the first
  # plate in a batch are determined randomly, and then the locations are advanced by
  # BETWEEN_PLATE_OFFSET for each subsequent plate. This is done to avoid the risk of
  # subsequent plates having the same negative control location, which would reduce the ability to
  # detect plate swaps.
  # WARNING! These needs to be a prime number (which isn't also a factor of the available well size)
  # to avoid re-using wells prematurely. These offsets are prioritised in order. Technically any
  # number that only shares 1 as a common factor with the available well size would work, but we
  # limit ourself to primes to simplify validation.
