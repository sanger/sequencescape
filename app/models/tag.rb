# frozen_string_literal: true
# A Tag is a short, know sequence of DNA which gets applied to a sample.
# The tag remains attached through subsequent processing, and means that it is
# possible to identify the origin of a sample if multiple samples are subsequently
# pooled together.
# Tags are sometimes referred to as barcodes by our users.
# Tag is stored on aliquot, and an individual aliquot can have two tags
# identified as tag and tag2, these may also be known as i7 and i5 respectively.
