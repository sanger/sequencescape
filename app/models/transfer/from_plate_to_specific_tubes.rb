class Transfer::FromPlateToSpecificTubes < Transfer::BetweenPlateAndTubes # rubocop:todo Style/Documentation
  # NOTE: This class appears to have been unused since July 2014.
  # We still have persistent models in the database, so need to make
  # sure records are updated when we strip this out. However, as
  # far as I can tell, we should be able to convert existing records to
  # Transfer::BetweenPlateAndTubes with no side effects, as all the behaviour
  # contained within here only affects the after_create callbacks.
  # Additionally: Remove ant transfer template using this class.
