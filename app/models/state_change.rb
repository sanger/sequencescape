# Performs a change of state on an asset.
#
#--
# This code assumes that there is no statemachine on the requests.  Whilst this is not true it will be in the
# future and we are safe to assume that, in the case of Pulldown, this is ok.  The state of a plate, or the MX
# library tube, in Pulldown is considered to be the state of the TransferRequests leading into it.  The state
# machine for the asset is defined within the client application, hence the statemachine on the requests will
# be removed from the core of sequencescape at some point.
