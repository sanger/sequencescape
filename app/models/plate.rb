# A plate is a piece of labware made up of a number of {Well wells}. This class represents the physical piece of plastic.
#
# - {PlatePurpose}: describes the role a plate has in the lab. In some cases a plate's purpose may change as it gets processed.
# - {Well}: Plates can have multiple wells (most often 96 or 384) each of which can contain multiple samples.
# - {PlateType}: Identifies the plates form factor, typically provided to robots to ensure tips are positioned correctly.
