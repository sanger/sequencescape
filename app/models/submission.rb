# A Submission collects multiple Orders together, to define a body of work.
# In the case of non-multiplexed requests the submission is largely redundant,
# but for multiplexed requests it usually helps define which assets will get
# pooled together at multiplexing. There are two Order subclasses which are important
# when it comes to submissions:
#
# {LinearSubmission}: Most orders fall in this category. If the submission is multiplexed
#                     results in a single pool for the whole submissions.
#
# {FlexibleSubmission}: Allows request types to specify their own pooling rules, which are
#                       used to define pools at the submission level.
#
# While orders are mostly in charge of building their own requests, Submissions trigger this
# behaviour, and handle multiplexing between orders.
