# Included in submission to add its state-machine
#
# Uses the following states:
# building - Initial state. Indicates the user is preparing the submissions
# pending - The submission has been finalized by the user and is awaiting processing.
#           Entry into this state queues the submission for processing by the {SubmissionBuilderJob}
# processing - The delayed job has picked up the submission and is currently building it
# ready - The submission has been processed and is ready for work
# failed - The {SubmissionBuilderJob} failed and the submission has not been processed
# cancelled - The submission was made in error or is no longer needed. Entry into this
#             state will cancel all requests in the submission.
