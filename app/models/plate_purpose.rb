# The standard {Purpose} class for plates. This defines the standard behaviour,
# and is the class used for the majority of PlatePurposes.
#
# @note JG: Generally I have been trying to eliminate as much of the purpose specific
#       behaviour as possible, and have pushed the business logic outwards towards the
#       pipeline applications themselves. This is to try and reduce the overall complexity
#       or Sequencescape models, reduce coupling between Sequencescape and its clients, and
#       to make behaviour of individual plates more predictable. This is intended to
#       increase the flexibility and adaptability of the pipelines.
