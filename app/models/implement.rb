# @deprecated This class doesn't appear to have been used. {Equipment} appears to be a better choice.
# Appears to have been intended to generate barcode for arbitrary instruments, beginning LE.
# Can't see any entries in the production database, so assume this went unused.
# The {Equipment} table does have entries, and seems to perform an almost identical function
# @note JG: Almost certainly safe to just drop the table and remove this file.
