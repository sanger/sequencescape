    # Warning: The code below is utterly horrible, and has already be the source of several bugs
    # It needs to be completely re-thought. The main difficulties are:
    # Comments can be both on the requests or on the plate itself
    # Rails handles counts on group statements strangely (See the Comments proxy on plate)

    if submissions.present?
      rids = Request.where(submission_id: submissions).pluck(:id)

        # Yuck! MySql57 issue.
        'MIN(comments.id) AS id, MIN(comments.title) AS title, MIN(comments.user_id) user_id, MIN(comments.description) AS description, MIN(created_at) AS created_at, MIN(updated_at) AS updated_at'

        rids, plate.id
      ]).group('CONCAT(comments.description, IFNULL(comments.title,""), comments.user_id)')
      # The above group by is grim, and is due to the way rails generates the key to help count
      # grouped statements. Essentially it adds AS on the end to create a new column. If we don't
      # concat, then if just uses the last element. The IFNULL is necessary as it seems that
      # if any element of a CONCAT statement is NULL, MySQL just returns NULL
    else
