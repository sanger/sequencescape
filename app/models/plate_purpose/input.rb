# Input Plate purposes are the initial stock plates passing into
# external piplines. They have special behaviour governing their state.
# This essentially makes sure that all non-empty wells on a plate have requests
# out of them before the plate it 'passed'. This is intended to ensure that submissions
# have been correctly built before a plate has processed.
#
# - Input plates are passed when all sample containing wells have requests out of them
#
# @note Limber should probably make decisions about plate state itself. This would increase
#       flexibility, such as by allowing library-manifest plates to pass straight in to the
#       pipeline.
