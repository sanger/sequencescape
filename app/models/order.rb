# And Order is used as the main means of requesting work in Sequencescape. Its
# key components are:
# Assets/AssetGroup: The assets on which the work will be conducted
# Study: The study for which work is being undertaken
# Project: The project who will be charged for the work
# Request options: The parameters for the request which will be built. eg. read length
# Request Types: An array of request type ids which will be built by the order.
#                This is populated based on the submission template used.
# Submission: Multiple orders may be grouped together in a submission. This
#             associates the two sets of requests, and is usually used to determine
#             what gets pooled together during multiplexing. As a result, sequencing
#             requests may be shared between multiple orders.
