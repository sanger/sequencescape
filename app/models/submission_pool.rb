  # JG [2018-10-12] LIMITATION: This currently uses the first request in a submission, so could cause
  # confusion if we have, say, cherry-picking requests upstream of library creation.
  # We currently have no submission templates like this active.
  # This value is used to work out if we have a cross-plate pool and therefore need
  # UDIs. Two things are likely to happen soon which make this concern redundant:
  # 1) We'll switch to UDIs only -> Actually there at time of writing, but there may be one more lot of 168s comming in
  # 2) Limber will be making the decision itself more directly
  # It was agreed with Jamie that it was more important to detect clashes than it was to handle unlikely
  # possible future scenarios.
