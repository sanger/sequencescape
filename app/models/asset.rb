# Asset is a very busy class which combines what should probably be two separate concepts:
# Labware: A physical item which can move round the lab, such as a {Plate} or {Tube}
#
# This class has now been split into two and should be eliminated.
#
# Key subclasses
# --------------
# - {Receptacle}: Something which can contain aliquots, such as a {Well} or {Tube}
#   Currently those these all share a table, and exhibit single table inheritance.
# - {Plate}: A piece of labware containing multiple receptacles known as {Well wells}.
#   Plates can be a variety of shapes and sizes, although the marority are 12*8 (96) or
#   24*16 (384) wells in size.
# - {Well}: A receptacle on a plate. Wells themselves do not exist independently of plates in reality,
#   although may occasionally be modelled as such.
# - {Tube}: A piece of labware with a single {Receptacle}. These behaviours are currently coupled together.
# - {Lane}: Forms part of a sequencing Flowcell. The flowcell itself is not currently modelled but can be
#   approximated by a {Batch}
# - {Fragment}: Represents an isolated segment of DNA on a Gel. Historical.
# - {Receptacle}: Abstract class inherited by any asset which can contain stuff directly
#
# Some of the above are further subclasses to handle specific behaviours.
