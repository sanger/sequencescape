# frozen_string_literal: true

# On {Study} creation the user selects a {StudyType} from a drop down list
# of pre-registered study types.
#
# This information is exposed:
#
# - In the warehouses, where it *may* be used by customers, NPG, or bioinformaticians
# - Via the V1 API. (Not aware of any uses here, but there may be)
# - As <STUDY_TYPE existing_study_type="..." /> during study accessioning with the EBI
#
# @note {Study::Metadata.study_type_valid?} has hard-coded validation to prevent the 'Not specified' study type from
#       being used. This should probably be updated to use the {#valid_for_creation} flag. I'm also not sure of having
#       'Not specified' be a specific database entry, although it has been assigned to several historic studies so does
#       at least allow a not_nil constraint.

  # @!attribute valid_for_creation
  #   @return [Boolean] Indicates a study can be created with this option (determines if it appears in the dropdown)
  # @!attribute vaild_type
  #   @return [Boolean] Indicates the study type is recognised by the EBI. If false the accessioned study will contain
  #                     <STUDY_TYPE existing_study_type="Other" new_study_type="<study_type.name>"/> instead of
  #                     <STUDY_TYPE existing_study_type="<study_type.name>"/>
