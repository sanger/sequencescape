  # The following two classes are redundant and are due for removal:
  # Stage 1:
  # Refactor to allow use of IlluminaC::Requests::LibraryRequest [Done: This commit]
  # Step 2:
  # Write migration to update existing request types / requests to use IlluminaC::Requests::LibraryRequest [Will be done soon]
  # Also update the configuration below to ensure the seeds behave correctly
  # Step 3:
  # Remove these classes
  # By splitting this process over three releases we avoid the need for downtime during migrations
