# A pipeline that has its inbox grouped by submission needs to provide specific paging capabilities.
# All requests for a submission must appear on the same page, i.e. if a submission has 200 requests
# and there are only 100 allowed per page, then all of these requests must appear on a page and not
# across two.

  # This module overrides the behaviour of will_paginate so that the requests for an individual
  # submission appear on the same page.  It does this by first paging the submission IDs, and then
  # limiting the query so that it only includes requests from these submissions.
