# A Lane is a section of a Flowcell which is capable of containing one or more
# {Sample samples} for sequencing. Samples are represented by {Aliquot aliquots}
# which are distinguished by their distinct {Tag tags}.
# Currently flowcells can be approximated in Sequencescape by the {Batch} created
# at the end of the {SequencingPipeline}
