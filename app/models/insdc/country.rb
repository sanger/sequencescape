module Insdc
  # Provides a controlled vocabulary describing names of countries or oceans/seas
  # in accordance with the INSDC (https://www.insdc.org/)
  #
  # In addition the list may contain non-geographic identifiers that are
  # permitted by the EBI sample checklists (eg 'not collected') An example
  # EBI checklist may be found here: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/ERC000011
  #
  # The list can be populated via the rake:task
  # `bundle exec rake insdc:countries:import`
  #
  # To import from an alternative sample sheet, use
  # `bundle exec rake insdc:countries:import[other_accession]`
  # @note be aware you may need to escape the square brackets if using zsh
