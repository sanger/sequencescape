# Purposes of this class represent multiplexed library tubes in the high-throughput
# pipeline. These tubes represent the cleaned-up normalized libraries at the end
# of the process that can pass directly into a {SequencingPipeline}.
# State changes on these tubes will automatically update the requests into the tubes

  #
  # Attempts to find the 'stock_plate' for a given tube. However this is a fairly
  # nebulous concept. Often it means the plate that first entered a pipeline,
  # but in other cases it can be the XP plate part way through the process. Further
  # complication comes from tubes which pool across multiple plates, where identifying
  # a single stock plate is meaningless. In other scenarios, you split plates out again
  # and the asset link graph is insufficient.
  #
  # JG: 2021-02-11: In this case we attempt to jump back through the requests. In most
  # limber pipelines this will actually return the plate on which you charge and pass.
  # See https://github.com/sanger/sequencescape/issues/3040 for more information

  # @deprecate Do not use this for new behaviour.

  # @param tube [Tube] The tube for which to find the stock_plate
