  # Class HeronRequest provides a means of tracking
  # Heron Tailed requests
  #
  # The heron process uses a very similar technique to GBS, however
  # rather than using the primer panel to amplify specific loci,
  # it uses a panel to amplify the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome.
  #
  # In the tailed process the library is processed in two parallel processes,
  # each of which applies duplicate tags. These two processes are later merged.
  # In order to allow for aliquot de-duplication when this merge occurs, we want
  # the same library id generated for both forks of the process. This is as
  # separate library ids would result in two aliquots in the merged tube, which
  # would violate the uniqueness constraint added to ensure tag uniqueness. In
  # order to achieve this we set the library id upfront. This is achieved by
  # adding it to the aliquot_attributes.
  #
  # Note: This may cause problems in future if two submissions are processed
  #       from the same cherrypicked plate, as both would share library ids.
