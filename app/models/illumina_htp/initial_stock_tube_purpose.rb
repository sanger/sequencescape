# Class initially used to represent the first tube in a pipeline following pooling
# from a plate. However appears to be a little more widespread in Limber pipelines.
# eg. LB Custom Pool Norm
# In fact, in the limber pipeline it appears to be responsible for any intermediate
# tubes.

  # Returns a summary of all related tube in the submission.
  # Limitation: doesn't understand pipelines, so just returns the tube at the head of the graph.
  # This isn't necessarily the one the users actually want, but we CAN validate that in Limber.
  # Additionally this will run into trouble if we end up wanting to use a tube earlier in the graph
  # (Such as following the introduction of a QC tube). Given that this will require knowledge of
  # the pipeline though, this logic is best shifted out into Limber.
