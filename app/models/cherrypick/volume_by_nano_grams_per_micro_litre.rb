# Included in {Well} to provide calculations for cherrypicking
module Cherrypick::VolumeByNanoGramsPerMicroLitre
  #
  # Used in the cherrypicking process to calculate the relative volumes of source
  # and buffer required to reach the target volume and concentration.
  #
  # - Ideally will aim for a target well containing volume `final_volume_desired`
  #   at concentration `final_conc_desired`
  # - This will be made by combining material from the source well (well_attribute.picked_volume)
  #   and buffer (well_attribute.buffer_volume)
  # - Maximum picked_volume is limited by the amount available (source_volume) and the amount you want
  #   in the target well (final_volume_desired)
  # - If source_volume < final_volume_desired then buffer will be added to make up final_volume_desired
  #   even if it reduces the target concentration below final_conc_desired
  #
  # @param final_volume_desired [Float] The volume to aim for in the target well (self)
  # @param final_conc_desired [Float] The concentration to aim for in the target well (self)
  # @param source_concentration [Float] The concentration (ng/ul) in the source well
  # @param source_volume [Float] The volume (ul) in the source well (ie. the maximum pick)
  # @param robot_minimum_pick_vol [Float] (ul) the minimum volume the robot can pick (the robot
  #        software will reject requests to pick less than this)
  #
  # @return [Float] The volume that we will instruct to robot to pick from the source well
