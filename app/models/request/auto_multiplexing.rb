# In the Generic Lims, transfer into the Multiplexed library tube is triggered
# automatically when the plate is passed. However, if multiplexing decisions
# are made after library creation, this step has already taken place. This
# callback ensure that the tube are generated after the submission is complete.
# The user may then log into generic Lims to see their plates.
# This issue is avoided in Limber by decoupling tube creation from plate passing
# allowing the step to be repeated at any time. This class can be removed if either
# the generic LIMS behaviour is updated, or moved into Limber.

  # will be triggered as part of the standard workflow.
