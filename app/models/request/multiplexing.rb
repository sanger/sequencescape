  # Triggers immediate transfer into the tubes if the source asset already
  # exists. This allows multiplexing requests to be made on plates at the
  # end of library prep, after the plate is qc_complete.
  # If no asset is present then we haven't got to that stage yet and transfer
  # will be triggered as part of the standard workflow.
