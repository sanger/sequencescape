# An aliquot can be considered to be an amount of a material in a liquid.  The material could be the DNA
# of a sample, or it might be a library (a combination of the DNA sample and a {Tag tag}).

# A note on tags:
# Aliquots can have up to two tags attached, the i7 (tag) and the i5(tag2)
# Tags are short DNA sequences which can be used to track samples following pooling.
# If two samples with the same tags are pooled together it becomes impossible to
# distinguish between them.
# To avoid this we have an index which ensures unique tags are maintained per pool.
# (Limitation: This restriction assumes that each oligo sequence is represented only once
# in the database. This is not the case, so additional slower checks are required where cross
# tag group pools are possible)
# MySQL indexes treat NULL values as non identical, so -1 (UNASSIGNED_TAG) is used to represent
# an untagged well.
# We have some performance optimizations in place to avoid trying to look up tag -1
# @see Tag
