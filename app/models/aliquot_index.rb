# An AliquotIndex is generated for all {Aliquot aliquots} in a {Lane} when the
# {Batch} is released. It gives each aliquot in the {Lane} a unique index which
# can get presented to NPG.
#
# @note Aliquot index replaces the role previously played by the tag map_id. It
# was added when dual indexing was added to ensure NPG still had a single identifier.

# @see AliquotIndexer The AliquotIndexer generates aliquot indexes for a given {Lane}
