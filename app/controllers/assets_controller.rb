# frozen_string_literal: true
# {Labware} and {Receptacle} used to both be grouped under {Asset} and this
# controller handled them. Now the majority of the behaviour has moved off into
# the respective controllers. This remains to handle a few legacy endpoints:
#
# show: Kept in place for CGP who were supposed to migrate off, but as of 23/12/2020
#       I'm (JG) still seeing activity. It might be we have another user who hasn't
#       migrated. Currently it just mimics the receptacle show behaviour for xml requests.
#       We also have a disambiguation page to handle links in from NPG, until they update
#       to use the receptacles endpoint. Again, we're still getting activity here, so
#       it looks like that hasn't happened yet.
# print_labels: This is used by the PhiX tubes created in the  PhiX::SpikedBuffersController
#               and PhiX::StocksController. It doesn't belong here.
# lookup: I can't find any links to this page, and it doesn't appear to have been used recently.
#         However our logs don't go back all that far. Provides a page for scanning in barcodes.
#         It appears to be supposed to redirect to the labware page, but it blows up for tubes
#         and shows the qc information for plates.
