#
# {#stage} is the main processing step, and responds to *all* HTTP methods.
# The currently active task is supplied by params[:stage]
#
# If params[:next_stage] is nil it will render the page associated with the current
# {Task} using {Task#render_task}
# If params[:next_stage] is present it will perform the current {Task} using {Task#do_task}
# before incrementing the stage and rendering the next task.
# If there are no further tasks present, it will redirect to the finish_batch page.
#
# @note A large amount of the task processing actually occurs within the controller.
#       These methods are included via the various Handler modules.

  # TODO: This needs to be made RESTful.
  # 1: Routes need to be refactored to provide more sensible urls
  # 2: We call them tasks in the code, and stages in the URL. They should be consistent
  # 3: This endpoint currently does two jobs, executing the current task, and rendering the next
  # 4: Some tasks rely on parameters passed in from the previous task. This isn't ideal, but it might
  #    be worth maintaining the behaviour until we solve the problems.
  # 5: We need to improve the repeatability of tasks.
  # 6: GET should be Idempotent. doing a task should be a POST
