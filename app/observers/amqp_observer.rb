    # A transaction is (potentially) a bulk send of messages and hence we can create a buffer that
    # will be written to during changes.  But transactions can be nested, which means that only the
    # very outer one should do any publishing.
    #
    #--
    # What follows looks complicated but is specialised to deal with a 'return' being called from
    # within the block.  In that case the 'return' causes the method to return and *not* to execute
    # any code after 'yield' in the code below.  Therefore you have the situation where the database
    # transaction has been committed but the AMQP broadcast has not happened.  But the 'ensure' block
    # is always called, so we assume the transaction to be good (i.e. commit) unless an exception is
    # raised (when it is marked as bad), and broadcast our buffer iff the transaction is good and
    # there's stuff to broadcast.
