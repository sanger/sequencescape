<%# This partial contains poly_metadata form fields for a study. It is included 
in the form to edit a study, i.e. for creating or updating a study. 

The key assignment is used to avoid repetition of the key string. form_collection 
is a helper method that generates a form group with a label and an input field. 

The label is generated using label_tag and the input field is generated using 
text_field_tag. The name for label_tag includes poly_metadata_ to match id of 
the input field. 

The name for text_field_tag includes poly_metadata[] to create a grouping in the 
params hash available in the controller. The value of the input field is set to 
the value of the poly_metadatum record found by the key. 

The last argument of the form_collection method is a string that provides 
information about the field, which is displayed as a help text under the input 
field.
