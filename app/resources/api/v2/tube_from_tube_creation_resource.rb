    # Provides a JSON:API representation of {TubeFromTubeCreation} for the creation of a single child tube from a single
    # parent tube.
    # Creation of this resource via a `POST` request will create the new child tube with the parent tube as an ancestor.
    # The created child will have the specified purpose and can be accessed via the {#child} relationship.
    #
    # @note This resource cannot be modified after creation: its endpoint will not accept `PATCH` requests.
    # @note Access this resource via the `/api/v2/tube_from_tube_creations/` endpoint.
