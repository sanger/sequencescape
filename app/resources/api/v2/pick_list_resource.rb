      # JSON API v1.0 doesn't have native support for creating nested resources
      # in a single request. In addition, as {PickList::Pick picks} are not backed
      # by real database records yet we could expect to run into issues anyway.
      # So we just expose our pick attributes. However, as we can't expect to
      # receive actual receptacles/studies/projects over the API, we convert them
      # from the ids. The RecordCache allows us to do this with a single database
      # query.
