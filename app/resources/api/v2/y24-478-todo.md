- [ ] Add tests to check `tag_index` and `tag2_index` are not updatable in `spec/resources/api/v2/aliquot_resource_spec.rb`
- [ ] Create `spec/resources/api/v2/asset_audits_resource_spec.rb`
- [ ] Add more tests to ``spec/requests/api/v2/aliquots_spec.rb`
- [ ] Add relationships for `asset` to `app/resources/api/v2/asset_audit_resource.rb` (see `app/resources/api/v2/tube_from_tube_creation_resource.rb`)
- [ ] Add more tests to `spec/requests/api/v2/asset_audits_spec.rb`, specifically testing the new relationships alongside the use their respective attributes (see `spec/requests/api/v2/tube_from_tube_creations_spec.rb`), and that PATCH requests are denied.
- [ ] Use `except: %i[update]` in `routes.rb` or the access restrictions in `app/resources/api/v2/base_resource.rb` for `app/resources/api/v2/asset_audit_resource.rb`, instead of declaring `self.updatable_fields(_context)`.
- [ ] Same as above for `app/resources/api/v2/comment_resource.rb`
- [ ] Can `app/resources/api/v2/asset_resource.rb` be removed? It seems the Asset model `app/models/asset.rb` has been deprecated.

- [ ] Can `app/resources/api/v2/fragment_resource.rb` be removed?

- [ ] `app/resources/api/v2/lot_resource.rb` - work out POST request
- [ ] Fix `tag_layout_template` for `app/resources/api/v2/lot_resource.rb`. Possibly add `received_at` and any other required attributes to the resource too.
