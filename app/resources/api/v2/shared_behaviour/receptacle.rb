# Provides behaviour for all receptacle resources
# While WellResource doesn't strictly speaking inherit from ReceptacleResource
# there is an implied inheritance in the API interface. As a result it makes
# sense to ensure that all methods present on Receptacle are also on Well
# (Liskov Substitution Principle) this is especially true for relationships,
# as it means we support pre-loading those relationships on mixed endpoints
