    # Provides a JSON:API representation of {SpecificTubeCreation}
    #
    # {SpecificTubeCreation} allows for the creation of multiple tubes from multiple parents.
    #
    # @note Access this resource via the `/api/v2/specific_tube_creations/` endpoint.
    # @note This resource cannot be modified after creation: its endpoint will not accept `PATCH` requests.
    #
    # A `POST` request to this resource will create new tubes with the specified parent tubes as ancestors.
    # The created child tubes will be assigned the given purposes and attributes and can be accessed
    # via the {#children} relationship.
    #
    # @example POST request with child purposes and parents specified by UUIDs (deprecated)
    #   POST /api/v2/specific_tube_creations/
