********************************** SERIOUSLY, YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THIS **********************************

You are quite clearly either wreckless, incompetent or careless.  You are trying to seed the #{Rails.env}
database which should never be done.  Please recheck your shell environment to ensure that Rails.env
is not set, or is set to either 'development' or 'test'.

  # those workflows have been created.  Ideally you will be preceeding your seed data with a 4 digit
  # 0-extended sequence number, i.e. 0001_foo.rb is executed *before* 0002_bar.rb.
