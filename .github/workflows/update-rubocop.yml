name: Update Rubocop

# This action automatically updates the rubocop gems within a
# repository and attempt to ensure that the resulting build passes.
# In order to use it effectively on a given project you should ensure:
# * All Rubocop associated gems are in the 'lint' group in the Gemfile
# * You update the 'BUNDLE_WITHOUT' section to exclude other groups, especially
#   those which will block `bundle install`
#
# Once added this will add an actions which:
# * Automatically runs at 10 am Sunday
# * Can be triggered manually via a workflow_dispatch (See link below)
# * Will automatically update all gems in the 'lint' group
# * Will run new safe autocorrect cops, and will add inline rubocop:todo for
#   other cops
# * Will automatically generate a pull request with the above changes.
