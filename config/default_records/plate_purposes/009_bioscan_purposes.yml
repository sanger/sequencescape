# These purposes support the Bioscan Lysis and Library prep pipelines
# There are two entry points for sample manifests:
# - Insect plate for the Lysis pipeline
# - Lysed material plate for the library prep pipeline

# of the Library prep pipeline. Once the Beckman automation for the lysis step is in
# place the entry point moves back to the insect plate at the start of the Lysis pipeline.
