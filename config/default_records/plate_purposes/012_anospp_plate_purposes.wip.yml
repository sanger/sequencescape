# Most are defined in the Limber config, but the below also need to be defined in Sequencescape.
# They are in a separate file so it can be 'feature flagged off' until needed.

# The 'LANS-96 Stock' purpose is included here so that it's available for
# sample manifests, and also because it is an acceptable purpose for the ANOSPP library prep
# submission template.
