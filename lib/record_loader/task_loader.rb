    # @param name [String] The name of the Task.

    # @return [Task, nil] The created Task, or `nil` if the Workflow is not found in specific environments.
    # @raise [ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound] If the Workflow is not found in environments other than
    # `development`, `staging`, or `cucumber`.
