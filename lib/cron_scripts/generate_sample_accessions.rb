  # This returns all samples that require an accession number to be generated based on the conditions of their
  # studies and themselves.  It comes from a long (and highly frustrating) experience of decoding the
  # app/models/data_release.rb logic.

  # We can't just join on studies, as this messes up rails subsequent eager loading,
  # and studies that don't meet the criteria won't be loaded. This causes issues if
  # we have non-accessioned EGA studies, and an accessioned ENA study. This would result
  # in mistaken accessioning to the ENA as the EGA studies would not get loaded.
