# Rake tasks

This is an attempt to rein the rake tasks. Some seem old and I'm (pj5) not sure when/where/if they
are used.

Since we will add support scripts here it might be helpful to add comment and RT ticket reference
here for prosterity.

To view all the tasks available, run `bundle exec rails -T`

To view all the support tasks, run `bundle exec rails -T support`
