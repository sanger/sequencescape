- [x] Task 4b: 4a Tests `spec/data/sample_manifest_excel/ranges.yml`

- [x] Task 5a: Tag Set model in `app/models/tag_set.rb`
  - (Tag Sets link together two related tag groups, but it can also be used to represent single index tag sets)
  - New method / scope called `dual_index_tag_sets` to filter only Dual Index Tag Sets
  - AND visible?
  - Option 1: Filter tag sets which have both a tag_group and tag2_group
  - Option 2: ?

- [x] Task 5b: 5a Tests `spec/models/tag_set_spec.rb`

- [ ] Task 6: Specialised fields
  - `app/sequencescape_excel/sequencescape_excel/specialised_field/chromium_tag_group.rb`
  - `app/sequencescape_excel/sequencescape_excel/specialised_field/chromium_tag_well.rb`
  - Create two new specialised fields files for `dual_index_tag_set` and `dual_index_tag_well`
  - Validation
    - `dual_index_tag_set` - Check the Tag Set exists, and that it has at least 1 tag group
    - `dual_index_tag_well` - Q: confirm what validation is needed?

- [ ] Task 7: Current Chromium manifest shows dual index tag groups
  - Is there a way to have Currently chromium manifest only show single index tag groups?
  - Option 1: Create new adapter types, e.g. chromium_single_index and chromium_dual_index and update each Tag Group in the DB
  - Option 2: Associate each tag group with a tag set, and filter tag sets on whether there is a tag2_group
  - Option 3: ?

- Task 8: Other tests
  - `spec/sample_manifest_excel/upload/row_spec.rb`
  - `spec/data/sample_manifest_excel/manifest_types.yml`
  - `spec/sample_manifest_excel/upload/processor_spec.rb`

## Questions

- Would Rich like a new adapter type called "Dual_index_tag_plate"? And update some existing Adapter Types?
- Confirm what validation is needed for `dual_index_tag_well` specialised field
