feature 'Retrospective failure' do
  # Occasionally users fail a well after additional work has been done
  # on it. This is usually because they forgot to fail the well
  # at the appropriate stage, although may also happen if additional information
  # comes to light later.
  #
  # When this occurs we need to walk downstream and remove matching aliquots.
  # An aliquot can be though of as matching when either:
  # 1) Its sample, tag, tag2, library id all match its immediate ancestor.
  # 2) The sample id matches and the other fields have been set for the first time
  #   (ie. were nil on the ancestor)
  #
  # Exception: When conducting QC, particularly MiSeq QC, we do not wish to retrospectively
  # remove aliquots form the QC tube or its descendants, as it is this QC process which
  # informed the QC decision. The sample should still be considered to be present.
  #
  # Limitations: In an ideal world we'd probably want the following behaviour:
  # 1) Failures on plates upstream of the plate from with the MiSeq tubes are made would still
  #    result in aliquots being removed from the QC tubes.
  # 2) Aliquots would not get removed from other QC plates.
  # However in practice these situations occur so rarely, and failure to handle them has
  # minimal consequence, that the additional code complexity outweighs the minor benefits.
