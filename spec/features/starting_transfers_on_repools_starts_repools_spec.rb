# In low input pipelines, and on re-pooling in the ISC pipeline
# a submission is made on a plate part way down the process. Usually
# this is the LB Lib-PCR XP plate. In keeping with the behaviour
# elsewhere in the pipeline, we need to ensure that the re-pool
# requests get started when the downstream plate is started. Previously
# this behaviour was reliant on the subclass of transfe request,
# TrnasferRequest::InitialTransfer, however this makes assumptions about
# plates in the pipeline which can no longer be relied upon, and furthermore
# is painful to handle through transfer request collections, as nested
# attributes do not play well with single table inheritance.

# Unfortunately all this happens as the same time as we're re-factoring transfer requests
# intent is to eliminate the need for initial transfer requests in the
# more advance branch.
