Feature: Custom text administration
  Administrators can create, edit, update and delete custom texts

  Background:
    Given all of this is happening at exactly "2010-Oct-03 18:11:17+01:00"

    Given I am a "Manager" user logged in as "xyz1"
    And I have administrative role
    And the following custom texts are defined
      | identifier | differential | content_type | content                |
      | foo        | 99           | letters      | Mary had a little lamb |
      | bar        | 101          | digits       | 3.1418                 |

  Scenario: manager views the list and edits an entry
    Given I am on the custom texts admin page
    Then the page should contain the following
    | text                   |
    | foo                    |
    | bar                    |
    | 99                     |
    | 101                    |
    | letters                |
    | digits                 |
    | Mary had a little lamb |
    | 3.1418                 |
    When I edit the custom text with identifier "foo" and differential "99"
    Then I should see "EDIT CUSTOM TEXT"
    And the field labeled "Custom text identifier" should contain "foo"
    And the field labeled "Custom text differential" should contain "99"
    And the field labeled "Custom text content type" should contain "letters"
    And the field labeled "Custom text content" should contain "Mary had a little lamb"

    # NOTE: Be careful when using symbols as the check is a regexp (i.e. no '?' and '$', unless you escape them!)
    Then I should be able to edit the following fields
      | label        | value   |
      | identifier   | wibble  |
      | differential | 42      |
      | content type | symbols |
      | content      | !$%&@   |

  Scenario: manager adds a new entry
    Given I am on the custom texts admin page
    And I follow "Create custom text"
    Then I should see "CREATE CUSTOM TEXT"

    # NOTE: Be careful when using symbols as the check is a regexp (i.e. no '?' and '$', unless you escape them!)

      | content      | !%@     |
    When I follow "View all custom texts"
    Then I should see "wibble"
    And I should see "foo"
    And I should see "bar"
    When I am editing the custom text field "wibble"
    Then I should see "EDIT CUSTOM TEXT"
