    When I press "Release this batch"
    Then I should see "Batch released!"
    When I follow "Print plate labels"
  	Then I should see "99999"
  	When I press "Print labels"
  	Then I should see "Your labels have been printed"

  Scenario: Print out the library tube barcodes
    Given I have a PacBio Sample Prep batch
    When I follow "Print labels"
    When I select "xyz" from "Print to"
    When I press "Print labels"
