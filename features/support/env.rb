# By default, any exception happening in your Rails application will bubble up
# to Cucumber so that your scenario will fail. This is a different from how
# your application behaves in the production environment, where an error page will
# be rendered instead.
#
# Sometimes we want to override this default behaviour and allow Rails to rescue
# exceptions and display an error page (just like when the app is running in production).
# Typical scenarios where you want to do this is when you test your error pages.
# There are two ways to allow Rails to rescue exceptions:
#
# 1) Tag your scenario (or feature) with @allow-rescue
#
# 2) Set the value below to true. Beware that doing this globally is not
# recommended as it will mask a lot of errors for you!

# Our features/api/* feature tests do some horrible things with UUIDs that override seed data.
# This is an issue because we set the seed data at the start of the test suite and assume it is not manipulated
# as our database cleaner strategy is to delete everything except seed data.
# 
# To fix this we cache the UUIDs at the start of the test suite, and then restore them after each scenario.
