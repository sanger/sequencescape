Feature: Bulk Submission
  So that biological work can be requested
  in a large batch rather than separate 
  submissions which take a long time to do,
  Users with privileges should be able to submit a
  csv spreadsheet with multiple submissions


  Background:
    Given I am logged in as "user"
    And I am using "local" to authenticate
    And I have administrative role
    And I have an "active" study called "abc123_study"
    And I have a project called "Test project"
    # And the study "abc123_study" has an asset group called "assetgroup123"
    And the study "abc123_study" has an asset group of 10 samples called "assetgroup123"
    # And I have a sample tube called "testing123" registered under study
    And study "abc123_study" has assets registered
   # And the sample tube "testing123" is in the asset group "assetgroup123"
    When I go to the create bulk submissions page
    Then I should see "Create a bulk submission"
   

  Scenario: Uploading a valid file with 1 submission
    When I upload a file with valid data for 1 submissions
    Then I should see "Bulk submission successfully made"
    And I should see "Your submissions:"
    And the preordered quota for project "Test project" should be:
         | RequestType                 | preordered | 
         | Cherrypicking for Pulldown  | 10         | 
         | Pulldown WGS                | 10         | 
         | HiSeq Paired end sequencing | 1          | 

  Scenario: Uploading a valid file where the project has no quotas but quota is enforced
    Given project "Test project" has enforced quotas
      And project "Test project" has no quotas
    When I upload a file with valid data for 1 submissions
    Then I should see "There was a quota problem"

  Scenario: Uploading a valid file where there is insufficent quota
    Given project "Test project" has enforced quotas
      And project "Test project" has 10 units of "Cherrypicking for Pulldown" quota
      And project "Test project" has 2 units of "Pulldown WGS" quota
      And project "Test project" has 1 units of "HiSeq Paired end sequencing" quota
    When I upload a file with valid data for 1 submissions
    Then I should see "Insufficient quota for Pulldown WGS"
