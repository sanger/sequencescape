Feature: Creating submissions through the submission templates
  Background:
    Given I am an "administrator" user logged in as "John Smith"

    Given I have a project called "Project testing submission templates"
    And project "Project testing submission templates" has enforced quotas
    And I have an active study called "Study testing submission templates"
    And the study "Study testing submission templates" has an asset group of 10 samples called "Asset group for submission templates"
    And the study "Study testing submission templates" has an asset group of 10 samples in "well" called "Asset group of wells for submission templates"
    And all of the wells are on a "Stock plate" plate

    Given all of this is happening at exactly "13-September-2010 09:30"
