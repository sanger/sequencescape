Feature: Submission and Order Creation
	As a Project Manager I want to be able to create a submission from a Study, a Project and some Assets,
	adding orders to the Submission before submitting it.

	Background:
		Given I am an "administrator" user logged in as "John Smith"
		And I am on the Submissions Inbox page


	Scenario: Building a Submission without any orders from scratch
		Given I follow "new Submission"
			And I find a Project using a few characters of the Financial Project Name
			And I find a Study using a few character of the Study Name
			And I select the first template from the template list
		Then I am presented with the Templates submission requirements
		Given I then agree to the Submission Requirements
			And I set the correct Submission Parameters for the template
		Then I am ready to add Orders to the Project

	# Scenario: Finishing an already started Submission
