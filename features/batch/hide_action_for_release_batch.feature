@batch
Feature: If a batch is released, the section Action/Task shouldn't be shown unless it is on a white list 

  Background: 
    Given I am logged in as "user"

  Scenario Outline: The show or hide the released Actions section for pipelines
  Given I have a "<batch_state>" batch in "<pipeline>"
    And I am on the last batch show page
  Then I should see "This batch belongs to pipeline: <pipeline>"
    And I should see "EVENTS"
    And I <should_or_should_not> see "ACTIONS"
