    And I select "xyz" from "Barcode printer"
    And I press "Submit"
    Then I should see "Please scan your user barcode"

  Scenario: Creating plates where the barcode service errors
    Given the plate barcode printing service will error

    When I select "Pulldown" from "Plate purpose"
    And I fill in "User barcode" with "2470000100730"
    And I select "xyz" from "Barcode printer"
    Then I expect an exception to be raised when I press "Submit"
    
  Scenario: Creating plates where the scanner appends a carriage return
    Given I am on the new plate page
    When I fill in "User barcode" with multiline text

    """
    When I select "Stock Plate" from "Plate purpose"
    And I select "xyz" from "Barcode printer"
    And I press "Submit"
    Then I should see "Created plates and printed barcodes"
    And I should be on the new plate page
    And the last printed label should contains:
      | Field | Value |
      | name  | Stock Plate       |
      | desc  | jack\s+ |
