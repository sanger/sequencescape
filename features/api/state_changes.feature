@api @json @state_change @single-sign-on @new-api @barcode-service
Feature: Access state changes through the API
  In order to actually be able to do anything useful
  As an authenticated user of the API
  I want to be able to create, read and update individual state changes through their UUID
  And I want to be able to perform other operations to individual state changes
  And I want to be able to do all of this only knowing the UUID of a state change
  And I understand I will never be able to delete a state change through its UUID

  Background:
    Given all HTTP requests to the API have the cookie "WTSISignOn" set to "I-am-authenticated"
    And the WTSI single sign-on service recognises "I-am-authenticated" as "John Smith"

    Given I am using the latest version of the API

    Given a user with UUID "99999999-8888-7777-6666-555555555555" exists

    Given the plate barcode webservice returns "1000001"
      And the plate barcode webservice returns "1000002"

    Given a "Stock plate" plate called "Source plate" exists
      And all wells on the plate "Source plate" have unique samples
      And a "Pulldown QC plate" plate called "Destination plate" exists
      And the UUID for the plate "Source plate" is "00000000-1111-2222-3333-000000000001"
      And the UUID for the plate "Destination plate" is "00000000-1111-2222-3333-000000000002"
      And the "Transfer columns 1-12" transfer template has been used between "Source plate" and "Destination plate"
      And "A1-H12" of the plate "Source plate" have been submitted to "Pulldown WGS - HiSeq paired end sequencing"
      And all requests are in the last submission
