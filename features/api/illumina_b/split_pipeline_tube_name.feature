Feature: The bottom of the illumina_b htp pipeline
  At the bottom of the illumina_b pipeline individual wells of the final plate are transferred into the
  MX library tubes on a 1:1 basis.  Once an MX library tube has been processed the act of changing its
  state to "passed" (or "failed", or whatever really), causes the illumin_b library creation requests,
  that run from the wells of the stock plate to the tube, to also be updated.

  Background:
    Given all HTTP requests to the API have the cookie "WTSISignOn" set to "I-am-authenticated"
      And the WTSI single sign-on service recognises "I-am-authenticated" as "John Smith"

    Given I am using the latest version of the API
And I have a "full" authorised user with the key "cucumber"

    Given a user with UUID "99999999-8888-7777-6666-555555555555" exists

    Given the plate barcode webservice returns "1000001"
      And the plate barcode webservice returns "1000002"

    Given the UUID for the plate purpose "Cherrypicked" is "11111111-2222-3333-4444-000000000001"
      And the UUID for the purpose "Lib Pool" is "88888888-1111-2222-3333-000000000001"
      And the UUID for the transfer template "Transfer wells to specific tubes defined by submission" is "22222222-3333-4444-5555-000000000001"
      And the UUID for the transfer template "Transfer from tube to tube by submission" is "22222222-3333-4444-5555-000000000002"
      And the UUID for the search "Find assets by barcode" is "33333333-4444-5555-6666-000000000001"
      And the UUID of the next plate creation created will be "55555556-6666-7777-8888-000000000001"
      And the UUID of the next state change created will be "44444444-5555-6666-7777-000000000001"

    Given a "Cherrypicked" plate called "Testing the API" exists
      And the UUID for the plate "Testing the API" is "00000000-1111-2222-3333-000000000001"
      And 4 wells on the plate "Testing the API" have unique samples

  Scenario: Dealing with the MX library tube at the end of the pipeline
    Given the UUID of the next submission created will be "11111111-2222-3333-4444-000000000010"
      And "A1-B1" of the plate with UUID "00000000-1111-2222-3333-000000000001" have been submitted to "Illumina-B - Pooled PATH - HiSeq Paired end sequencing"
      And the UUID of the next submission created will be "11111111-2222-3333-4444-000000000020"
      And "C1-D1" of the plate with UUID "00000000-1111-2222-3333-000000000001" have been submitted to "Illumina-B - Pooled PATH - HiSeq Paired end sequencing"

    Given all submissions have been worked until the last plate of the "Illumina-B HTP" pipeline
      And all plates have sequential UUIDs based on "00000000-1111-2222-3333"
      And all multiplexed library tubes have sequential UUIDs based on "00000000-1111-2222-3333-9999"
      # And the plate "Plate 1000002" is "qc_completed"
