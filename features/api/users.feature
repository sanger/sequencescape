@api @json @user @single-sign-on @new-api
Feature: Access users through the API
  In order to actually be able to do anything useful
  As an authenticated user of the API
  I want to be able to create, read and update individual users through their UUID
  And I want to be able to perform other operations to individual users
  And I want to be able to do all of this only knowing the UUID of a user
  And I understand I will never be able to delete a user through its UUID

  Background:
    Given all of this is happening at exactly "23-Oct-2010 23:00:00+01:00"

    Given all HTTP requests to the API have the cookie "WTSISignOn" set to "I-am-authenticated"
    And the WTSI single sign-on service recognises "I-am-authenticated" as "John Smith"

    Given I am using the latest version of the API
