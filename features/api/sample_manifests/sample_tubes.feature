@api @json @sample_manifest @sample_tube @single-sign-on @new-api @barcode-service
Feature: Access sample manifests through the API
  In order to actually be able to do anything useful
  As an authenticated user of the API
  I want to be able to create, read and update individual sample manifests through their UUID
  And I want to be able to perform other operations to individual sample manifests
  And I want to be able to do all of this only knowing the UUID of a sample manifest
  And I understand I will never be able to delete a sample manifest through its UUID

  Background:
    Given all HTTP requests to the API have the cookie "WTSISignOn" set to "I-am-authenticated"
    And the WTSI single sign-on service recognises "I-am-authenticated" as "John Smith"

    Given I am using the latest version of the API

    Given I have an "active" study called "Testing sample manifests"
    And the UUID for the study "Testing sample manifests" is "22222222-3333-4444-5555-000000000000"

    Given a supplier called "John's Genes" with ID 2
    And the UUID for the supplier "John's Genes" is "33333333-1111-2222-3333-4444444444444"

  @read
  Scenario: Reading the JSON for a UUID
    Given the sample manifest exists with ID 1
    And the UUID for the sample manifest with ID 1 is "00000000-1111-2222-3333-444444444444"
    And the sample manifest with ID 1 is owned by study "Testing sample manifests"
    And the sample manifest with ID 1 is supplied by "John's Genes"
    And the sample manifest with ID 1 is for 1 sample tube

    Given the "1D Tube" barcode printer "d999bc" exists
    Given the sample manifest with ID 1 has been processed
    And the barcode of the last sample tube is "9999"
    And the Sanger sample ID of the last sample is "WTCCC99"

    When I GET the API path "/00000000-1111-2222-3333-444444444444"
    Then the HTTP response should be "200 OK"
    And the JSON should match the following for the specified fields:
