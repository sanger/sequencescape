@api @json @tube_creation @single-sign-on @new-api @barcode-service
Feature: Access creation creations through the API
  In order to actually be able to do anything useful
  As an authenticated user of the API
  I want to be able to create, read and update individual tube creations through their UUID
  And I want to be able to perform other operations to individual tube creations
  And I want to be able to do all of this only knowing the UUID of a tube creation
  And I understand I will never be able to delete a tube creation through its UUID

  Background:
    Given all HTTP requests to the API have the cookie "WTSISignOn" set to "I-am-authenticated"
      And the WTSI single sign-on service recognises "I-am-authenticated" as "John Smith"

    Given I am using the latest version of the API
And I have a "full" authorised user with the key "cucumber"

    Given a user with UUID "99999999-8888-7777-6666-555555555555" exists

    Given the plate barcode webservice returns "1000001"
      And the plate barcode webservice returns "1000002"

    Given a plate purpose called "Parent plate purpose" with UUID "11111111-2222-3333-4444-000000000001"
      And a tube purpose called "Child tube purpose" with UUID "11111111-2222-3333-4444-000000000002"

    Given a "Parent plate purpose" plate called "Testing the API" exists
      And the UUID for the plate "Testing the API" is "00000000-1111-2222-3333-000000000001"
      And the plate "Testing the API" will pool into 1 tube

  # NOTE: we cannot predefine the ID here so we ignore it in the uuids_to_ids map
  @create
  Scenario: Creating a tube creation
    Given the UUID of the next tube creation created will be "55555555-6666-7777-8888-000000000001"
