Feature: Access barcode printers through the API
  In order to actually be able to do anything useful
  As an authenticated user of the API
  I want to be able to create, read and update individual barcode printers through their UUID
  And I want to be able to perform other operations to individual barcode printers
  And I want to be able to do all of this only knowing the UUID of a barcode printer
  And I understand I will never be able to delete a barcode printer through its UUID

  Background:
    Given all HTTP requests to the API have the cookie "WTSISignOn" set to "I-am-authenticated"
    And the WTSI single sign-on service recognises "I-am-authenticated" as "John Smith"

    Given I am using the latest version of the API

  @read
  Scenario Outline: Reading the JSON for a barcode printer
    Given the "<printer_type>" barcode printer "<printer_type> printer" exists
      And the UUID for the barcode printer "<printer_type> printer" is "00000000-1111-2222-3333-444444444444"

    When I GET the API path "/00000000-1111-2222-3333-444444444444"
    Then the HTTP response should be "200 OK"
     And the JSON should match the following for the specified fields:
      """
