Feature: Access volume updates through the API
  In order to actually be able to do anything useful
  As an authenticated user of the API
  I want to be able to create individual volume updates through their plate UUID
  And I understand I will never be able to delete a volume update through its UUID
  And I understand I will never be able to update a volume update through its UUID

  Background:
    Given all HTTP requests to the API have the cookie "WTSISignOn" set to "I-am-authenticated"
    And the WTSI single sign-on service recognises "I-am-authenticated" as "John Smith"

    Given I am using the latest version of the API
And I have a "full" authorised user with the key "cucumber"

    Given a user with UUID "99999999-8888-7777-6666-555555555555" exists

    Given a plate called "Plate 1" with ID 1
      And the plate "Plate 1" has a barcode of "1220000333802"
      And the UUID for the plate "Plate 1" is "11111111-2222-3333-4444-000000000003"
      And I have a plate with uuid "11111111-2222-3333-4444-000000000003" with the following wells:
       | well_location | measured_concentration | measured_volume |
       | B1            | 100                    | 20              |
       | B2            | 120                    | 10              |
       | B3            | 140                    | 20              |
       | B4            | 160                    | 20              |
       | B5            | 180                    | 20              |
       | B6            | 200                    | 20              |

  Scenario: Creating volume updates on a plate

    Given the UUID of the next volume update created will be "11111111-2222-3333-4444-000000000001"

    Then the HTTP response should be "201 Created"
     And the JSON should match the following for the specified fields:

      {
