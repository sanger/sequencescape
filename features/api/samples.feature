@api @json @sample @single-sign-on @new-api
Feature: Access samples through the API
  In order to actually be able to do anything useful
  As an authenticated user of the API
  I want to be able to read individual samples through their UUID
  And I want to be able to perform other operations to individual samples
  And I want to be able to do all of this only knowing the UUID of a sample
  And I understand I will never be able to delete a sample through its UUID

  Background:
    Given all HTTP requests to the API have the cookie "WTSISignOn" set to "I-am-authenticated"
    And the WTSI single sign-on service recognises "I-am-authenticated" as "John Smith"

    Given I am using the latest version of the API
    And I have a "full" authorised user with the key "cucumber"
