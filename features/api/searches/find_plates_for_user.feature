Feature: Searching for assets by barcode
  Background:
    Given all of this is happening at exactly "12-Jun-2012 23:00:00+01:00"
    Given all HTTP requests to the API have the cookie "WTSISignOn" set to "I-am-authenticated"
    And the WTSI single sign-on service recognises "I-am-authenticated" as "John Smith"

    Given I am using the latest version of the API
    And I have a "full" authorised user with the key "cucumber"

    Given the UUID for the search "Find Illumina-C plates for user" is "00000000-1111-2222-3333-444444444446"

    Given the plate barcode webservice returns "1000001"
      And the plate barcode webservice returns "1000002"
      And the plate barcode webservice returns "1000003"
      And the plate barcode webservice returns "1000004"
      And the plate barcode webservice returns "1000005"
      And the plate barcode webservice returns "1000006"

      Given a "Stock Plate" plate called "stock plate" exists
      And a "ILC Stock" plate called "Testing the API A" exists
      And the UUID for the plate "Testing the API A" is "00000000-1111-2222-3333-000000000001"
      And all wells on the plate "Testing the API A" have unique samples
      And passed transfer requests exist between 1 wells on "stock plate" and "Testing the API A"
      And a "ILC AL Libs" plate called "Testing the API B" exists
      And the UUID for the plate "Testing the API B" is "00000000-1111-2222-3333-000000000002"
      And a "ILC Lib PCR" plate called "Testing the API C" exists
      And the UUID for the plate "Testing the API C" is "00000000-1111-2222-3333-000000000003"
      And a "ILC Lib PCR-XP" plate called "Testing the API D" exists
      And the UUID for the plate "Testing the API D" is "00000000-1111-2222-3333-000000000004"
      And a "Cherrypicked" plate called "Testing the API E" exists
      And the UUID for the plate "Testing the API D" is "00000000-1111-2222-3333-000000000005"
      And pending transfer requests exist between 1 wells on "stock plate" and "Testing the API B"
      And pending transfer requests exist between 1 wells on "stock plate" and "Testing the API C"
      And pending transfer requests exist between 1 wells on "stock plate" and "Testing the API D"

    Scenario: I should be able to find plates for a particular user
        Given user "plate_owner" exists with barcode "owner"
        Given the UUID of the last user created is "00000000-1111-2222-3333-100000000001"
        Given user "plateless" exists with barcode "plateless"
        Given the UUID of the last user created is "00000000-1111-2222-3333-100000000002"
        And there is an asset link between "Stock Plate" and "Testing the API B"

        Given the plate "Testing the API B" is started by "plate_owner"
        Given the plate "Testing the API C" is started by "plate_owner"
        Given the plate "Testing the API E" is started by "plate_owner"
