Feature: Searching for studies, projects and samples by name
  Background:
    Given all HTTP requests to the API have the cookie "WTSISignOn" set to "I-am-authenticated"
    And the WTSI single sign-on service recognises "I-am-authenticated" as "John Smith"

    Given I am using the latest version of the API
    Given there are no samples

  Scenario Outline: Looking for a single entry
    Given the UUID for the search "Find <model> by name" is "00000000-1111-2222-3333-444444444444"

    Given a <model> called "Testing_the_API_1" with ID 1
      And the UUID for the <model> "Testing_the_API_1" is "11111111-2222-3333-4444-000000000001"

    Given a <model> called "Testing_the_API_2" with ID 2
      And the UUID for the <model> "Testing_the_API_2" is "11111111-2222-3333-4444-000000000002"

    Then the HTTP response should be "301 Moved Permanently"
     And the JSON should match the following for the specified fields:
