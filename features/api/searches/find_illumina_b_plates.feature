Feature: Searching for Illumina-B plates by barcode
  Background:
    Given all of this is happening at exactly "12-Jun-2012 23:00:00+01:00"
    Given all HTTP requests to the API have the cookie "WTSISignOn" set to "I-am-authenticated"
    And the WTSI single sign-on service recognises "I-am-authenticated" as "John Smith"

    Given I am using the latest version of the API
    And I have a "full" authorised user with the key "cucumber"

    Given a "Stock Plate" plate called "stock plate" exists with barcode "1000001"
    And a "ILB_STD_INPUT" plate called "Testing the API A" exists with barcode "1000002"
    And the UUID for the plate "Testing the API A" is "00000000-1111-2222-3333-000000000001"
    And all wells on the plate "Testing the API A" have unique samples
    And passed transfer requests exist between 1 wells on "stock plate" and "Testing the API A"
    And the plate with UUID "00000000-1111-2222-3333-000000000001" has been submitted to "Illumina-B - Multiplexed WGS - HiSeq Paired end sequencing"
    And a "ILB_STD_COVARIS" plate called "Testing the API B" exists with barcode "1000003"
    And the UUID for the plate "Testing the API B" is "00000000-1111-2222-3333-000000000002"
    And a "ILB_STD_PCR" plate called "Testing the API C" exists with barcode "1000004"
    And the UUID for the plate "Testing the API C" is "00000000-1111-2222-3333-000000000003"
    And a "ILB_STD_PCRXP" plate called "Testing the API D" exists with barcode "1000005"
    And the UUID for the plate "Testing the API D" is "00000000-1111-2222-3333-000000000004"
    And pending transfer requests exist between 1 wells on "stock plate" and "Testing the API B"
    And pending transfer requests exist between 1 wells on "stock plate" and "Testing the API C"
    And pending transfer requests exist between 1 wells on "stock plate" and "Testing the API D"

  Scenario: I should be able to find Illumina-B Plates

    Given the UUID for the search "Find Illumina-B plates" is "00000000-1111-2222-3333-444444444444"
