@api @json @asset @search @single-sign-on @new-api @barcode_search @barcode-service
Feature: The search interface should return outstanding Pre-PCR plates
  Background:
  Given all of this is happening at exactly "12-Jun-2012 23:00:00+01:00"
  Given all HTTP requests to the API have the cookie "WTSISignOn" set to "I-am-authenticated"
  And the WTSI single sign-on service recognises "I-am-authenticated" as "John Smith"

  Given I am using the latest version of the API

  Given the UUID for the search "Find outstanding Illumina-B pre-PCR plates" is "00000000-1111-2222-3333-444444444444"

  Given the plate barcode webservice returns "1000001"
    And the plate barcode webservice returns "1000002"
    And the plate barcode webservice returns "1000003"
    And the plate barcode webservice returns "1000004"
  
    Given a "Stock Plate" plate called "stock plate" exists
    And a "ILB_STD_PREPCR" plate called "Pending PrePCR" exists
    And the UUID for the plate "Pending PrePCR" is "00000000-1111-2222-3333-000000000001"
    And a "ILB_STD_PREPCR" plate called "Started PrePCR" exists
    And the UUID for the plate "Started PrePCR" is "00000000-1111-2222-3333-000000000002"
    And a "ILB_STD_PREPCR" plate called "Passed PrePCR" exists
    And the UUID for the plate "Passed PrePCR" is "00000000-1111-2222-3333-000000000003"
    And pending transfer requests exist between 1 wells on "stock plate" and "Pending PrePCR"
    And started transfer requests exist between 1 wells on "stock plate" and "Started PrePCR"
    And passed transfer requests exist between 1 wells on "stock plate" and "Passed PrePCR"
  
Scenario: I should be able to find Illumina-B Plates
  
  When I POST the following JSON to the API path "/00000000-1111-2222-3333-444444444444/all":
    """
    {
      "search": {
      }
    }
    """
    
    Then the HTTP response should be "300 Multiple Choices"
     And the JSON should match the following for the specified fields:
      """
