Feature: Searching for qcables by asset barcode
  Background:
    Given all of this is happening at exactly "23-Oct-2010 23:00:00+01:00"

    Given all HTTP requests to the API have the cookie "WTSISignOn" set to "I-am-authenticated"
    And the WTSI single sign-on service recognises "I-am-authenticated" as "John Smith"

    Given I am using the latest version of the API
And I have a "full" authorised user with the key "cucumber"

    Given the UUID for the search "Find qcable by barcode" is "00000000-1111-2222-3333-444444444444"

    Given I have a lot type for testing called "Test Lot Type"
      And the tag layout template "Test tag layout" exists
      And the lot exists with the attributes:
      | lot_number | lot_type      | received_at | template        |
      | 1234567890 | Test Lot Type | 2014-02-01  | Test tag layout |
      And I have two qcables
