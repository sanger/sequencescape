@api @json @uuid @lookup @single-sign-on @new-api
Feature: The API provides a lookup feature for legacy ID values to UUIDs
  In order to be able to map the internal IDs I have stored from previous API versions to the new UUIDs
  As an authenticated user of the API
  I want to be able to lookup a single UUID based on the model and internal ID and be redirected to the resource
  And I want to be able to lookup multiple UUIDs and be given a list of their mappings

  Background:
    Given all HTTP requests to the API have the cookie "WTSISignOn" set to "I-am-authenticated"
    And the WTSI single sign-on service recognises "I-am-authenticated" as "John Smith"

    Given I am using the latest version of the API
And I have a "full" authorised user with the key "cucumber"

    Given there are no samples

  @error
  Scenario Outline: Not authenticated if the WTSISignOn cookie is not sent
    Given no cookies are set for HTTP requests to the API

    When I POST the following JSON to the API path "/uuids/<service>":
      """
      {
        "lookup": <json>
      }
      """
    Then the HTTP response should be "401 Unauthorized"
    And the JSON should be:
      """
      {
        "general": [ "no authentication provided" ]
      }
      """

    Examples:
      | service | json                               |
      | lookup  | { "model": "sample", "id": 1 }     |
      | bulk    | [ { "model": "sample", "id": 1 } ] |

  @error
  Scenario Outline: Not authenticated if the single sign-on service says you are not
