Feature: Assigning bait libraries to a plate
  The bait libraries are actually assigned based on the submission from the user but to provide client
  applications with the ability to preview this information it is (optionally) a two-step process.

  Background:
    Given all HTTP requests to the API have the cookie "WTSISignOn" set to "I-am-authenticated"
      And the WTSI single sign-on service recognises "I-am-authenticated" as "John Smith"

    Given I am using the latest version of the API
And I have a "full" authorised user with the key "cucumber"

    Given a user with UUID "99999999-8888-7777-6666-555555555555" exists

    Given the UUID for the search "Find assets by barcode" is "33333333-4444-5555-6666-000000000001"

    Given the plate barcode webservice returns "1000001"
      And the plate barcode webservice returns "1000002"

    # Setup the plates so that they flow appropriately.  This is a bit of a cheat in that it's only
    # a direct link and that we're faking out the pipeline work but it suffices.
    Given a "SC stock DNA" plate called "Testing bait libraries" exists
      And all wells on the plate "Testing bait libraries" have unique samples
      And the UUID for the plate "Testing bait libraries" is "00000000-1111-2222-3333-000000000001"

    Given "A1-H6" of the plate with UUID "00000000-1111-2222-3333-000000000001" have been submitted to "Pulldown SC - HiSeq Paired end sequencing" with the following request options:
      | read_length       | 100                 |
      | bait_library_name | Human all exon 50MB |

    Given "A7-H12" of the plate with UUID "00000000-1111-2222-3333-000000000001" have been submitted to "Pulldown SC - HiSeq Paired end sequencing" with the following request options:
      | read_length       | 100            |
      | bait_library_name | Mouse all exon |

    Given a "SC hyb" plate called "Target for bait libraries" exists as a child of "Testing bait libraries"
      And the "Transfer columns 1-12" transfer template has been used between "Testing bait libraries" and "Target for bait libraries"
      And the UUID for the plate "Target for bait libraries" is "00000000-1111-2222-3333-000000000002"
