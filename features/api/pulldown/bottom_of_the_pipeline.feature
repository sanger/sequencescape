Feature: The bottom of the pulldown pipeline
  At the bottom of the pulldown pipeline individual wells of the final plate are transfered into the
  MX library tubes on a 1:1 basis.  Once an MX library tube has been processed the act of changing its
  state to "passed" (or "failed", or whatever really), causes the pulldown library creation requests,
  that run from the wells of the stock plate to the tube, to also be updated.

  Background:
    Given all HTTP requests to the API have the cookie "WTSISignOn" set to "I-am-authenticated"
      And the WTSI single sign-on service recognises "I-am-authenticated" as "John Smith"

    Given I am using the latest version of the API
    And I have a "full" authorised user with the key "cucumber"

    Given a user with UUID "99999999-8888-7777-6666-555555555555" exists

    Given the plate barcode webservice returns "1000001"
      And the plate barcode webservice returns "1000002"

    Given the UUID for the plate purpose "WGS stock DNA" is "11111111-2222-3333-4444-000000000001"
      And the UUID for the transfer template "Transfer wells to MX library tubes by submission" is "22222222-3333-4444-5555-000000000001"
      And the UUID for the search "Find assets by barcode" is "33333333-4444-5555-6666-000000000001"
      And the UUID of the next plate creation created will be "55555555-6666-7777-8888-000000000001"
      And the UUID of the next state change created will be "44444444-5555-6666-7777-000000000001"

    Given a "WGS stock DNA" plate called "Testing the API" exists
      And the UUID for the plate "Testing the API" is "00000000-1111-2222-3333-000000000001"
      And 8 wells on the plate "Testing the API" have unique samples

      And "E1-H1" of the plate with UUID "00000000-1111-2222-3333-000000000001" have been submitted to "Pulldown ISC - HiSeq Paired end sequencing"

    Given all submissions have been worked until the last plate of the "Pulldown ISC" pipeline
      And all plates have sequential UUIDs based on "00000000-1111-2222-3333"
