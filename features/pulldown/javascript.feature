Feature: Print barcodes for the cherrypicking for pulldown and pulldown multiplex pipelines

  Background:
    Given I am a "administrator" user logged in as "user"
    And the "96 Well Plate" barcode printer "xyz" exists
    
    
  Scenario: Create a Tecan file with correct volumes to pick via the original Cherrypick interface
    Given a plate template exists
    Given a robot exists
    Given a plate barcode webservice is available and returns "99999"
    Given I have a plate "222" with the following wells:
      | well_location | measured_concentration | measured_volume |
      | B1            | 100                    | 20              |
      | B2            | 120                    | 10              |
      | B3            | 140                    | 20              |
      | B4            | 160                    | 20              |
      | B5            | 180                    | 20              |
      | B6            | 200                    | 20              |
    And I have a plate "333" with the following wells:
      | well_location | measured_concentration | measured_volume |
      | C3            | 10                     | 30              |

      | C8            | 600                    | 10              |
      | D1            | 90                     | 10              |
      | D2            | 50                     | 10              |
      | D3            | 40                     | 15              |
      | D4            | 50                     | 20              |
    Given I have a cherrypicking submission for plate "222"
    And I have a cherrypicking submission for plate "333"
    Given I am on the show page for pipeline "Cherrypick"
    When I check "Select DN222J for batch"
    And I check "Select DN333P for batch"
    And I press "Submit"
    When I follow "Start batch"
    When I choose "Pick by ng"
    And I fill in the following:
      | Minimum Volume    | 10   |
      | Maximum Volume    | 50   |
      | Quantity to pick  | 1000 |
    And I press "Next step"
		When I press "Submit"
    Given the last batch has a barcode of "550000555760"
    Then the downloaded tecan file for batch "550000555760" and plate "1220099999705" is
