    And I press "Next step"
    Then I should see "Assign Tags to Wells"
    When I press "Next step"
    When I press "Release this batch"
    Given all library tube barcodes are set to know values
    Then I should see "Batch released!"
    And I follow "Batch Report"
    When I look at the pulldown report for the batch it should be:
