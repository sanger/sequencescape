Feature: Cherrypicking for Pulldown pipeline

  Background:
    Given I am a "administrator" user logged in as "user"
    Given I have a project called "Test project"
    And project "Test project" has enough quotas
    Given I have an active study called "Test study"
    And I have an active study called "Study A"
    And the "96 Well Plate" barcode printer "xyz" exists

  Scenario: I select 2 pulldown plates for a batch, but the max is 1  
    Given I have 2 pulldown plates
    Given I am on the show page for pipeline "Pulldown Multiplex Library Preparation"
    When I check "Select DN99999F for batch"
    And I check "Select DN88888N for batch"
    And I press "Submit"
    Then I should see "Too many request groups selected, maximum is 1"
    
  Scenario: View pulldown report for batch without assigning tags in batch
    Given I have a tag group called "UK10K tag group" with 8 tags
    Given I have a pulldown batch
    Given all library tube barcodes are set to know values
    And I follow "Batch Report"
    When I look at the pulldown report for the batch it should be:
     | Plate    | Well | Study      | Pooled Tube    | Tag Group | Tag | Expected Sequence | Sample Name      | Measured Volume | Measured Concentration |
