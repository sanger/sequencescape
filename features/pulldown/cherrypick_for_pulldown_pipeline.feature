Feature: Cherrypicking for Pulldown pipeline

  Background:
    Given I am a "administrator" user logged in as "user"

  Scenario: All parts of a submission across multiple plates must be in batch
    Given I have a "Cherrypicking for Pulldown - Pulldown Multiplex Library Preparation - HiSeq Paired end sequencing" submission with 2 plates
    Given I am on the show page for pipeline "Cherrypicking for Pulldown"
    When I check "Select DN222J for batch"
    And I press "Submit"
    Then I should see "All plates in a submission must be selected"
    When I check "Select DN222J for batch"
    And I check "Select DN333P for batch"
    And I press "Submit"
    Then I should see "This batch belongs to pipeline: Cherrypicking for Pulldown"

  Scenario: Dont allow more than 96 wells in a batch
    Given I have a project called "Test project"
    And project "Test project" has enough quotas
    Given I have an active study called "Test study"
    And I have an active study called "Study A"
  
    Given the CherrypickForPulldownPipeline pipeline has a max batch size of 2
    Given plate "1234567" with 2 samples in study "Test study" has a "Cherrypicking for Pulldown" submission for cherrypicking
    Given plate "222" with 1 samples in study "Study A" has a "Cherrypicking for Pulldown" submission for cherrypicking
    Given I am on the show page for pipeline "Cherrypicking for Pulldown"
    Then I should see "This pipelines has a limit of 2 requests in a batch"
    Then I should see "There are 3 requests available."
    When I check "Select DN1234567T for batch"
    And I check "Select DN222J for batch"
    And I press "Submit"
    Then I should see "Maximum batch size is 2"
    Then I should see "This pipelines has a limit of 2 requests in a batch"
    Then I should see "There are 3 requests available."

 Scenario: Cherrypick for pulldown from 2 submissions from different studies and view worksheet
   Given I have a project called "Test project"
   And project "Test project" has enough quotas
   Given I have an active study called "Test study"
   And I have an active study called "Study A"
   And the "96 Well Plate" barcode printer "xyz" exists
 
   Given plate "1234567" with 8 samples in study "Test study" has a "Cherrypicking for Pulldown" submission for cherrypicking
   Given plate "222" with 8 samples in study "Study A" has a "Cherrypicking for Pulldown" submission for cherrypicking
   Given plate "1234567" has nonzero concentration results
   Given plate "222" has nonzero concentration results
   
   Given I am on the show page for pipeline "Cherrypicking for Pulldown"
   When I check "Select DN1234567T for batch"
   And I check "Select DN222J for batch"
   And I press "Submit"
   Then I should see "This batch belongs to pipeline: Cherrypicking for Pulldown"
   And I should see "Cherrypick Group By Submission"
   Given a plate barcode webservice is available and returns "99999"
   When I follow "Start batch"
   When I fill in "Volume Required" with "13"
   And I fill in "Concentration Required" with "50"
   And I select "Pulldown Aliquot" from "Plate Purpose"
   And I press "Next step"
   When I press "Release this batch"
   Then I should see "Batch released!"
   And I should see "Pulldown Aliquot"
   Given the last batch has a barcode of "550000555760"
   Then the downloaded tecan file for batch "550000555760" and plate "1220099999705" is
