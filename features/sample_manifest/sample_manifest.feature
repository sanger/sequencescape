@sample @manifest @barcode-service
Feature: Sample manifest
  In order to request genotyping on samples
  As a collaborator
  I want to be able to insert manually a list of samples
  So that Lab Technicians know what to expect to work with
  And be able to track progress of work
  And keep cost under control

  Background:
    Given I am an "External" user logged in as "john"
    And the configuration exists for creating sample manifest Excel spreadsheets
    And the "96 Well Plate" barcode printer "xyz" exists

    Given a supplier called "Test supplier name" exists
    And I have an active study called "Test study"
    Given the study "Test study" has a abbreviation
    And user "john" is a "manager" of study "Test study"
    And the study have a workflow
    Given I am visiting study "Test study" homepage
    Then I should see "Test study"
    When I follow "Sample Manifests"

  Scenario: Setting of reference_genomes
    Given a manifest has been created for "Test study"
    And the reference genome "Dragon" exists
    And the reference genome "Centaur" exists
    When I fill in "File to upload" with the file "test/data/sample_manifest_reference_genomes.csv"
    And I press "Upload manifest"
    Given 1 pending delayed jobs are processed
    When I refresh the page
    Then I should see the manifest table:
      | Contains | Study      | Supplier           | Manifest       | Upload             | Errors | State     |
      | 1 plate  | Test study | Test supplier name | Blank manifest | Completed manifest |        | Completed |
    Then the sample reference genomes should be:
     | sanger_sample_id | reference_genome |
     | sample_1         | Dragon           |
     | sample_2         | Dragon           |
     | sample_3         | Dragon           |
     | sample_4         | Dragon           |
     | sample_5         | Dragon           |
     | sample_6         | Centaur          |
     | sample_7         | Centaur          |
     | sample_8         | Centaur          |

  Scenario: Using an invalid reference genome
    Given a manifest has been created for "Test study"

    When I fill in "File to upload" with the file "test/data/sample_manifest_reference_genomes.csv"
    And I press "Upload manifest"
    Given 1 pending delayed jobs are processed

    When I follow "Errors for manifest for Test study"
    Then I should see "Couldn't find a Reference Genome with named 'Centaur'."
