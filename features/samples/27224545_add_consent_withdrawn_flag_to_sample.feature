@sample
Feature: Patients should be able to withdraw consent
  So as to track withdraw of consent
  Samples should be able to be flagged as withdrawn
  This should be presented to downstream users
  
  Background:
    Given all of this is happening at exactly "2010-Sep-08 09:00:00+01:00"
    And I am an "Manager" user logged in as "user"
    And I have an active study called "Study A"
    And user "user" is a "manager" of study "Study A"
    And I have an "approved" project called "Project A"
    And the project "Project A" has quotas and quotas are enforced
    Given there are no samples
    And the study "Study A" has the sample "sample_withdrawn" in a well and asset group
    And the study "Study A" has the sample "sample_okay" in a well and asset group
    And the patient has withdrawn consent for "sample_withdrawn"

  Scenario: Withdrawn consent is presented downstream
    When I am on the samples page for study "Study A"
    Then I should see "Consent withdrawn" within ".withdrawn"
    And I should see "sample_withdrawn" within ".withdrawn"
    And I should not see "sample_okay" within ".withdrawn"
    When I am on the show page for sample "sample_okay"
    Then I should not see "Patient consent has been withdrawn for this sample."
    When I am on the show page for sample "sample_withdrawn" 
    Then I should see "Patient consent has been withdrawn for this sample."
  
  Scenario: Withdrawn consent is visible in sample xml
    When I get the XML for the sample "sample_okay"
    Then the text of the as is XML element "//sample/consent_withdrawn" should be "false"
    When I get the XML for the sample "sample_withdrawn"
    Then the text of the as is XML element "//sample/consent_withdrawn" should be "true"
    
  @batch
  Scenario: Withdrawn consent is visible in batch xml
    Given the batch exists with ID 1
    And the UUID for the batch with ID 1 is "00000000-1111-2222-3333-444444444444"
    And batch "1" in "Pulldown library preparation" has been setup with "sample_okay_group" for feature 27224545
    When I get the XML for the batch "1"
    Then the value of the "consent_withdrawn" attribute of the XML element "//batch/lanes/lane/library/sample" should be "false"
    
    Given the batch exists with ID 2
    And the UUID for the batch with ID 2 is "00000000-1111-2222-3333-666666666666"
    And batch "2" in "Pulldown library preparation" has been setup with "sample_withdrawn_group" for feature 27224545
    When I get the XML for the batch "2"
    Then the value of the "consent_withdrawn" attribute of the XML element "//batch/lanes/lane/library/sample" should be "true"

  Scenario: Withdrawn consent is presented to the warehouse
    And I am using version "0_5" of a legacy API
    And the UUID for the sample "sample_withdrawn" is "00000000-1111-2222-4444-444444444444"
    And the UUID for the sample "sample_okay" is "00000000-1111-2222-4444-555555555555"
    And the sanger sample id for sample "00000000-1111-2222-4444-444444444444" is "1STDY123"
    And the sanger sample id for sample "00000000-1111-2222-4444-555555555555" is "1STDY124"
    
    When I GET the API path "/samples/00000000-1111-2222-4444-444444444444"
    And ignoring "id|updated_at" the JSON should be:
