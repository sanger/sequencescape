Feature: display an overview of all plates going through QC in SLF

   Background:
     Given I am an "slf_manager" user logged in as "john"
     And I have an active study called "Test Study"
     # And a "Stock Plate" plate purpose and of type "Plate" with barcode "1221234567841" exists
     And there is a 1 well "Stock Plate" plate with a barcode of "1221234567841"
     And asset with barcode "1221234567841" belongs to study "Test study"
     And the "96 Well Plate" barcode printer "xyz" exists
     And I am on the sample logistics homepage
     Given all of this is happening at exactly "14-Feb-2011 23:00:00+01:00"
     Given user "jack" exists with barcode "ID100I"

   Scenario: A plate hasnt started QC
     When I follow "QC overview"
     Then the overview of the plates should look like:
     | Study | Stock | QC started | Pico Analysed | Gel Analysed | Sequenom Stamp |
