Feature: I wish to create samples and push them all the way through QC in SLF
  Background:
    Given the Sanger sample IDs will be sequentially generated

    Given I am a "administrator" user logged in as "user"
    And the "96 Well Plate" barcode printer "xyz" exists
    Given user "jack" exists with barcode "ID100I"
    Given a faculty sponsor called "Jack Sponsor" exists

    # NOTE: The first barcode is used for all of the child plates, except one, but the code still
    # seems to need the additional barcodes for some reason.  Can't quite work that one out at the
    # moment.
    Given the plate barcode webservice returns "1234567"
    And the plate barcode webservice returns "1000000..1000001"
    And the plate barcode webservice returns "99999"

    Given a plate template exists
    Given a robot exists
    Given a supplier called "Test supplier name" exists

  @manifest
  Scenario: Push a plate all the way through SLF to genotyping
    Given I have a project called "Test project"
    And project "Test project" has enough quotas

    When I go to the homepage
    And I follow "Create study"
    When I fill in "Study name" with "Test study"
    And I fill in "Study description" with "writing cukes"
    And I fill in "ENA Study Accession Number" with "12345"
    And I select "Jack Sponsor" from "Faculty Sponsor"
    And I fill in "Study name abbreviation" with "CCC3"
    And I select "Yes" from "Do any of the samples in this study contain human DNA?"
    And I select "No" from "Does this study contain samples that are contaminated with human DNA which must be removed prior to analysis?"
    And I select "No" from "Does this study require the removal of X chromosome and autosome sequence?"
    And I select "open" from "What is the data release strategy for this study?"

    # NOTE[xxx]: This feels like a bit of a hack but I can't see a way to turn off enforce_accessioning
    # at this level of the UI.  Apparently no studies that come through the SLF pipeline will need accession
    # numbers and so it's trying to turn that check off.
    And I select "genotyping or cytogenetics" from "What sort of study is this?"
    When I press "Create"
    
    Given I am on the sample db homepage
    When I follow "Create manifest for plates"
    When I select "Test study" from "Study"
    And I select "default layout" from "Template"
    And I select "Test supplier name" from "Supplier"
    And I select "xyz" from "Barcode printer"
    And I fill in "Count" with "1"
    When I press "Create manifest and print labels"
    Given 3 pending delayed jobs are processed
    When I follow "View all manifests"
    When I follow "Manifest for Test study"
    Then study "Test study" should have 96 samples

    # Then I should fill in the spreadsheet offline and save as a csv
    # And I should upload the file
    Given sample information is updated from the manifest for study "Test study"

    Given the internal QC plates are created
    Given I have a "DNA QC - Cherrypick - Genotyping" submission for plate "1234567" with project "Test project" and study "Test study"

    Given I am on the gel QC page
    When I fill in "barcode" with "1234567"
    When I press "Update gel values"
    When I select from the following:
      | Well A1 | No Band |
      | Well B2 | Pass    |
      | Well C3 | Fail    |
      | Well D4 | Weak    |
      | Well E5 | Degraded|
    And I press "Update gel values"

    Given plate "1221234567841" has concentration and sequenom results

    When I follow "Reception"
    When I select "Plate" from "type_id"
    And I fill in "barcode_0" with "1221234567841"
    And I press "Submit"
    When I select "Sample logistics freezer" from "asset_location_id"
    And I press "Confirm"

    Given I am on the show page for pipeline "DNA QC"
    
    When I check "Select DN1234567T for batch"
    And I select "Create Batch" from "action_on_requests"
    And I press "Submit"
    When I follow "Start batch"
    Then I should see dna qc table:
